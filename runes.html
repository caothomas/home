			<h1>Runes</h1>
			<p>Runes are the most important items in the game. Having rare and powerful monsters is one thing, but without good runes, even
				a natural 3 star monster with good runes and the right rune set can defeat a natural 5 star monster. Now many people might be wondering
				, how does runes work and how can I get better runes? Well of course your not gonna get better runes just because you read this website.
				I am just gonna tell you where can you find good runes and what can you do to make your runes better. First, what are runes?
				Runes are items that drop in almost anywhere in the game. You can get them by completing challenges, clearing the scenario,
				TOA(tower of ascension), world boss, and even more that I have yet to name. Every monster have 6 rune slots. You may place
				any type of rune you want in the slots, but the slots are numbered from 1 through 6. Once you get a rune there will be a number
				beside the type of rune and the rarity of the rune. The number the rune has can only go into that rune slot. The effects of a runes
				will only work once its has been placed on the monster, or in other works engraved on the monster. Think carefully about what runes
				you want to engrave on the monster because removing them comes with a price. The better the rune is, as in number of stars, enhancements
				and rarity of the rune, the more mana stones it will cost to have it removed. If you do not want the rune and want to just replace
				the rune then go ahead. The rune will be lost and unrecoverable. Paying the price and having the rune removed will allow you to 
				keep the rune and you can place the rune on another monster that you want. Now about the quality of the rune. Stars,
				number of enhancements, and rarity determine the quality of the rune as mentioned before. There are 3 parts of a rune, the main effect,
				sub effect, and the set effect. The main effect is as the name suggests, the main effect/buff the runes will provide for the monster
				it is engraved on. The number of stars will determine how good the main effect is. For example, a 1 star rune might have a main effect of
				+3 attack, while a 3 star rune might have a main effect of +7 attack. The max number of stars a rune can have is 6. The sub effect of 
				a rune is extra effects/buffs that the rune provides but is not as good as the effect/buff would be if it was a main effect. For example,
				a 3 star rune can have a main attack of +7 attack while a 3 star rune with a main effect of +7 defense and a sub effect of +3 attack.
				The rarity of the rune determines how many sub effect the rune has. Runes can come in all kinds of rarities. There are normal, magic, rare,
				hero, and legend, having normal being the worst and legend being the best. Enhancing a rune will increase its main effect as well as sub 
				effects. For every 3 enhancements the rune will go up a grade. If the rune was a normal rune, the with 3 successful enhancements it will
				become a magic rune. For every 3 enhancements will also give the rune an extra sub effect. The total number of sub effects a rune can have is 4.
				To find runes the better runes will drop according to the level of the stage. In the scenario/map, putting the settings to hell will allow you
				to get better runes. In the cairos dungeon, the stronger the boss, the better the runes that it will drop. Another way to get runes is the world
				boss. He has a chance to drop runes and since he is unlocked when the player finishes the scenario and has at least 10 monsters level 30 or over,
				that means that he will only drop runes with decent number of stars. Down below is a chart on all the different types of runes that can be obtained
				throughout the game.</p>
			<h3>Crafting runes</h3>
			<p>In this game, there are some special runes that can only be obtained by crafting. There is a building that is unlocked
				at level 19 called crafting building. The crafting building is where you can craft other buildings, a special monster called the 
				Homunculus, and various items using crafting material. In the crafting building you can also craft runes. There are currently 
				a total of 5 possible runes to craft. The runes consist of fight runes, determination runes, enhance runes, accuracy runes, and
				tolerance runes. All of these runes is a 2 set piece and grants all allies buffs. Fight runes grants 8% attack to all allies,
				determination runes grants 8% defense to all allies, enhance runes grants 8% HP to all allies, accuracy runes grants all allies
				10% accuracy, and the final rune, tolerance runes grants all allies 10% resistance.
